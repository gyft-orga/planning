As a user, I want to mark gift as something I'm getting, as to communicate to
other profile visitors that the given gift is "taken".

Acceptance:
- warning if gift already taken by other user

---

As a visitor, I will see that other users have marked a number of gifts as
something they will be getting for the profile owner.

Acceptance:
- ?? the profile owner shall not even see the anonymous info

---

As a user, I will see the users who have marked what gifts as something they
will be getting for the profile owner.

Acceptance:
- user is not profile owner

---

As a profile owner, I can report spam/abuse "takings" to flag people you don't
know (and from whom you did not get the marked gift.)

Acceptance:
- account suspension after two reports, open to manual appeal (mailto: admins)
