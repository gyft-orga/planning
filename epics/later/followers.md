As a user, I want to follow a profile owner.

---

As a user, I want to see how profile owner follows and by whom they are being
followed.

Description:
compare: githubs following system

---

As a user that is following other users, I want to see list of upcoming events
for those whom I am following.

Acceptance:
- only followed users
- only future events
- ordered by date (closest to furthest)
- no duplicate events (e.g. birthday 2x)
- shared events are grouped (e.g. christmas)

UI:
- on each events show a selection of the gifts the user wants (if any, only for
gifts assigned to those specific events)
