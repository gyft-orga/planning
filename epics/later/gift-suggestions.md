As an uninspired user, I want to see some suggestions for gifts to add.

Description:
After signing up some user might not know what to add.
Provide some examples:
  - small things like snacks: Ferrero Raffaello
  - stuff for projects I'm working on:
    - phrased as: "What are you building right now? Need some parts?"
    - fahradreifen: https://smile.amazon.de/Continental-Contact-Reflex-Reifen-schwarz/dp/B01N7XKHCQ
    - raspberry pi 4
    - Schneiderschere: https://smile.amazon.de/Zwilling-Superfection-Schneiderschere-Edelstahl-rostfrei/dp/B000XRQ0EU
Suggest import from Amazon wishlist or goodreads.

Purpose: Keep the user engaged and putting at least one item on their profile.
