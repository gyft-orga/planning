As a user, as I give gifts and interact with the app I want to unlock
achievements which are display on my profile.

Description:
- compare: Ebay Kleinanzeigen Badges, Productivity Challenge Timer achievements
- gamification to keep users interested

---

As a serious user, I want to disable gamification elements (badges,
achievements), as to not be annoyed by them.

UI:
- in user management

---

As a active user, if I'm within the n upper percent I want to see where I stand.

Description:
- incentivise competitive users
- reward early adopters
- percentiles: global 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%

Acceptance:
- only counts claimed & confirmed gifts

Dev Notes:
- only makes sense >1000 users
- calculate internal highscore list once a day, write cut of numbers into db
