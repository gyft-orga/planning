As a profile owner, I want to be notified that I should update my gift list for
an upcoming event.

Acceptance:
- notifications can be toggled for different events individually
- or for all at once

---

As a user, I can disable notifications by category.

Acceptance:
- categories available to toggle:
  - upcoming events (prompt to update gift list)
  - claims on your gifts
  - reponses to your claims
  - other?
