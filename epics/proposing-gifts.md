As a user, I can propose gift to the profile owner.

UI:
- section that allows for input
- same process as a profile owner creating a new gift

---

As a profile owner, I can react to gifts proposed to me.

Acceptance:
- proposing user will be notified of reaction
- the reaction can be:
  - negative
  - positive
  - neutral?
- profile owner can leave a short comment explaining their reaction

---

As a gift proposer, after the profile owner has reacted favorably, I can
choose to claim the gift.

Acceptance:
- claiming the created gift is the preferred way (UX highlight)
- claiming the gift is still done deliberately (so it does not raise a wrong
expecation in the profile owner that the creator of a proposed gift is
also automatically going to get that thing)
