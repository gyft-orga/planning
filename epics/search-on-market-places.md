As a visitor, I want to click the icons for popular market-places to look up the
gift there.

Acceptance:
- gift has a name
- gift does not have a link of its own
- user goes to their regional variant (amazon.de, amazon.co.uk)
- link has affiliate marketing id

Dev Notes:
- Put product name into query: https://smile.amazon.de/s?k=%s
- the icons are the favicon of the websites
  - domain/favicon.ico
